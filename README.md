# CS-111-Connect-4
This is the project program I coded at Boston University in the Fall of 2019. This program creates a Connect 4 game playable by either two players, a player and programmed AI, or two programmed AI players. This series of files contains the code for the board, which appears on the console when the game is initiated, a player, defined either by "X" or "O", an AI player, whose programmed to place pieces on the board to prevent an immediate loss, and play winning moves, and the code which combines all other codes to initiate the game and announce a winner, if any.

Looking back at it now, this code was a lot of fun, and I see no errors. A good extension to this code would be to program a Smart AI, which analyzes potential threats 2+ moves before they are made, rather than responding to the immediate move. This is something to look back and edit in the future.
